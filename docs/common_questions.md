## Does it work on consoles?

The GameTest Framework, an API this addon relies on, does not on work on Playstation nor the Nintendo Switch as of writing. Theoratically, it should work on XBox, but it hasn't been tested. If you want to use it on consoles, you can host a server/world somewhere else and join that world.

## Why doesn't the addon work on my Android?

Strangely the addon doesn't seems to work for some Android devices. There isn't a known reason why, but until that's resolved, you can try using the addon from a server hosting site, such as Aternos. If that doesn't work, then there's likely a bug with the addon that you may report on [here](https://github.com/SIsilicon/WorldEdit-BE/issues).

## Can I use WorldEdit with other addons?

It should be compatible with any other addon you have in your world.

## Why does the message "History was already being recorded" show?

Something went wrong while the addon was being used. Restarting the world might fix this, but if not, please report the issue [here](https://github.com/SIsilicon/WorldEdit-BE/issues).

## Are you affiliated with the original mod creators?

Nope! I developed this addon on my own.
